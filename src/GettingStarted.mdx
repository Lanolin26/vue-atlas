## Installation

## Quickstart

## Note on using atlas to construct a layout

f you already have a layout and do not want to use the App component to manage your layout, then you can ignore this.

It is worth mentioning that the App keeps track of whether or not the page is considered mobile. You're able to
specify different values for desktop and mobile dimensions of the Topbar, Minibar and Sidebar so that your pages
look exactly how you'd like them to look in either viewport.

Other components, such as the Range component, subscribe to the App's isMobile status. This is so that on mobile,
we're able to make certain adjustments under the hood to improve the user experience with that particular component.
For this type of responsiveness to work, it must be a descendent of the App, as the App only broadcasts mobility
status to its children.
